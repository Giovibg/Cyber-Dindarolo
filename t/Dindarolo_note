/backend: all general configurations of the backend(settings.py, urls...). Done in django.

Main API features:

-Nobody which is not authenticated can do nothing.

Authentication with JWT:	- login (if account available) posting username and password at: /api/token/.
				- register account posting username, email,password,confirm password at /jwt_auth/register/.
				- Both login and register returns an Access Token(valid for 5minutes) and a Refresh token(valid for 24h).


			

Add product:			-Each user can add a product (and gain a credit), posting name, description, quantity and unit_price to /api/products/ 
				-If a product is already available:
					- new quantity available = previous quantity available + new_quantity inserted.
					- new unit price for product will be weighted:  ((previous unit_price * previous quantity) +(new unit_price * new_quantity)) / total_quantity)

				- New budget available for user: old budget available + (quantity * unit_price)



Make a transaction(buy something):	Each user can buy a product, previously inserted from someone, posting name of product and quantity of pieces we want to buy to /api/transactions/
				   	If sufficient budget, if sufficient quantity available => transaction created. New budget for user = old_budget - (quantity_bought * unit_price_product).


View list of all products available inserted by users: - GET at /api/products/ 	=> return: product_name, description, quantity_available, weighted unit_price 

-View History of transactions made by an user:		-GET at /api/transactions/   => return: product name, quantity bought, unit_price bought, subtotal, currency, date of transaction, type of transaction(positive or negative transaction)
